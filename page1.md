Page 1 — What Are Digital Protocols?

Digital protocols are the rules that computers and devices follow to communicate.  
Without protocols, the internet, texting, streaming, email, and online gaming would not work.

A protocol defines:
- How data is formatted
- How data is sent
- How devices identify each other
- What to do when data is missing or broken

Everyday Examples
You use protocols every day:
- Sending a text message (SMS protocol)
- Visiting a website (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Playing online games (TCP/UDP)
- Emailing (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)

Why Protocols Exist  
Computers need to “agree” on how to talk.  
Protocols guarantee that devices from anywhere in the world can communicate reliably, even if they were built by different companies.

OSI Layers (Simple View)
Protocols often operate at different layers:

1. Application Layer – Websites, apps  
2. Transport Layer – TCP, UDP  
3. Network Layer – IP  
4. Physical/Data Link – Wi-Fi, Ethernet  

Each layer has its own responsibilities.
