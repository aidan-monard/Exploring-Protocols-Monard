# Page 2 — Common Internet Protocols

This page explains several important digital protocols that make modern communication possible.

---

## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
HTTP is used for loading web pages. It allows browsers and servers to communicate and transfer text, images, and page structure. It is not encrypted by default.

---

## HTTPS (Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
HTTPS is the secure, encrypted version of HTTP. It protects data being sent between a user and a website, improving privacy and safety.

---

## TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)
TCP/IP is the core communication model of the internet.  
- TCP ensures data arrives correctly and in order.  
- IP handles addressing and routing so data reaches the right destination.  

Together, they form the foundation of all online communication.

## DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS acts like the internet’s address book. It translates human-readable website names into numerical IP addresses so computers can locate and connect to the correct servers.

---

## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
FTP is used for transferring files between a user and a server. It is commonly used for website management, backups, and moving large files across networks.
