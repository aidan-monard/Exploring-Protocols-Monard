Page 3 — Why Protocols Matter

Digital communication depends entirely on protocols.  
Here’s why they are essential:

---

1. Universal Communication  
Protocols allow devices worldwide to communicate no matter what company made them.

---

2. Reliability  
Protocols like TCP ensure that:
- Data arrives in the correct order  
- Missing data is resent  
- Connections stay stable  

---

3. Security  
Protocols such as HTTPS and SSL/TLS help protect:
- Passwords  
- Personal information  
- Banking and shopping data  

---

4. Efficiency  
Protocols determine:
- How fast data moves  
- How data is broken up  
- How networks handle traffic  

---

Summary  
Digital protocols are the backbone of the internet.  
Without them, none of our digital systems—web browsing, email, streaming, online gaming, texting—would function.
